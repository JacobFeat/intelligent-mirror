# Intelligent Mirror

I have designed an intelligent mirror as my engineering project, which offers a seamless blend of functionality and innovation. The mirror is equipped with built-in speakers that allow users to interact with it through voice commands.

The mirror can display real-time information on its surface, such as the date, weather, and room temperature. It can also access a user's calendar and display their events, as well as provide news updates from around the world or Poland, categorized into topics for easy browsing.

One of the most exciting features of this mirror is its ability to show users the route to a destination on a map, simply by speaking the name of the place they want to go. This feature is made possible through the integration of smart technology, which allows the mirror to recognize and interpret voice commands accurately.

Overall, this intelligent mirror is an excellent example of how technology can be used to improve everyday living. It provides users with a range of useful features that help simplify their lives while adding a touch of elegance to their homes.
